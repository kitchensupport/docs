## Problem Statement
Novice chefs tend to not know what they can make with the ingredients that they have. This leads to wasted food and more money spent on eating out. Our system will be different from existing products by focusing on finding unique dishes really quickly based on what you have in your house right now.

## Background Information
This is a problem that many of us on our team have experienced, especially since coming to college. We are targeting people with little experience cooking for themselves as a way to help them find new, interesting things to make with the ingredients that they already have. Many websites and apps let you find recipes online, but most require you to know what dish you want to prepare ahead of time, and it will tell you what you need in return. Our app takes that normal flow and reverses it, which we think could be very useful for finding new meals, as well as saving money by not wasting any ingredients.

### Non-Functional

3. We want to make sure that the UI for each of our applications is modern and aligns with current best practices on it's respective platform
4. We want to make sure that our database and login system is secure, and that all traffic is encrypted using HTTPS following current best practices in security

6. We want to develop the API using Node.js and Express
7. We want to develop the web app using Backbone.js, which will consume the same API as the mobile apps

In addition to these items, we keep a live backlog on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/3Mf33yse/project-backlog).
